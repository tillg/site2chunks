# Markdown Chunking Configuration
# This file controls the behavior of chunk.py

# Input directory containing markdown files to chunk
input_dir: cleaned

# Output directory for chunked markdown files
output_dir: chunks

# Target chunk size in characters
chunk_size: 1200

# Character overlap between consecutive chunks
chunk_overlap: 150

# Comma-separated heading levels to split on
# Use # for H1, ## for H2, etc.
headers: "#,##,###,####,#####,######"

# Chunking strategy to use
# Options:
#   - "smart": Smart header-aware splitter (recommended)
#              Finds last high-level header before chunk_size limit
#              Avoids tiny chunks and respects document structure
#   - "legacy": Original two-stage LangChain splitter
#              Splits at all headers, then splits large sections
strategy: "smart"

# Maximum header level for smart strategy (1-6)
# Only used when strategy="smart"
# 1 = only H1, 2 = H1-H2, 3 = H1-H3, etc.
max_header_level: 3

# Flush output directory before chunking (removes all existing chunks)
# When true, deletes the entire output directory before processing
flush: true
